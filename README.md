Project Report: Music Recommendation System
Phase #1: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Pipeline
The initial phase of the project involves creating an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline utilizing the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. FMA is a comprehensive dataset suitable for various endeavors in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The dataset consists of 106,574 tracks, each lasting 30 seconds and spanning 161 unevenly distributed genres. Additionally, the fma_metadata.zip file provides essential track details such as title, artist, genres, tags, and play counts for all tracks.

Tasks:

Data Acquisition: Download the fma_large.zip dataset containing audio tracks and the fma_metadata.zip file containing track details.
Data Loading: Utilize Python to load the dataset and extract relevant features using methods like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), spectral centroid, or zero-crossing rate.
Feature Extraction: Perform feature extraction to convert audio files into numerical and vector formats. Consider techniques like MFCC to capture audio characteristics effectively.
Data Transformation: Explore normalization, standardization, and dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance the accuracy of the recommendation model.
Data Storage: Store the transformed data in a scalable and accessible manner using MongoDB for efficient retrieval and processing.
Phase #2: Music Recommendation Model 
In the second phase, Apache Spark is leveraged to train a music recommendation model. You have the flexibility to choose between Apache Spark's MLlib machine learning library or explore deep learning methodologies for improved accuracy, utilizing frameworks like PyTorch through the TorchDistributor API.

Tasks:

Model Training: Utilize Apache Spark to train the recommendation model using algorithms such as collaborative filtering and Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN).
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using various evaluation metrics to ensure its effectiveness in recommending music tracks to users.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance and ensure that the selected parameters are supported by your implementation.
Phase #3: Deployment
The final phase focuses on deploying the trained model onto a web application, specifically a streaming service. The web application is expected to provide an interactive user experience while seamlessly integrating the recommendation system.

Tasks:

Web Application Development: Develop an interactive music streaming web application with a user-friendly interface using frameworks like Flask or Django.
Real-time Recommendation: Implement Apache Kafka to dynamically generate music recommendations in real-time based on historical playback data, tailoring suggestions to each user's preferences.
User Activity Monitoring: Monitor user activity within the web application to generate personalized recommendations, without requiring users to upload audio files.
Integration: Integrate the recommendation system with the web application to provide a seamless user experience, where recommendations are generated in real-time as users interact with the platform.
Conclusion:
The completion of this project will result in a robust music recommendation system deployed on a streaming web application. By leveraging ETL pipelines, advanced machine learning techniques, and real-time data processing, the system aims to deliver personalized music recommendations to users, enhancing their overall listening experience.
